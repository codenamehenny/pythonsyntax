#Task 1: Grocery Store Math Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. 
coffee, milk, eggs = 15, 3, 6 # prices
total = coffee + milk + eggs # cost of those items
print(total)

# Task 2: Bank Interest If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year.
initial_balance = 1000 # starting amt in savings acct
interest_rate= 0.04
new_balance = initial_balance * interest_rate + initial_balance #interest calculated for the balance then added to inital balance
print(new_balance) # balance after a year of accruing interest
