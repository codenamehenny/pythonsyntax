#Task 1: Code Correction You have been given a piece of code with several variable and constant names that don't follow the Python naming convention. 
# Your task is to correct them:

pi_value = 3.14  # changed pi to lowercase
user_age = 25  # snake case instead of camel case
user_location = "New York"  # changed to snake case
MAX_LIMIT = 1000 # kept all caps for constant but changed to snake case
